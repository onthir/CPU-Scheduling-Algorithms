All the instructions are provided through 'process_table.txt' file

First Line: ['first', 'shortest']
    First lines detects the algorith to use.
    'first' implements First come first serve algorithm
    'shortest' implements Shortest Job Next algorithm

Second Line: [process_id,arrival_time,cpu_burst]
    Second Line is just a header with three columns seperated with a comma (,)

Third and rest of the lines
    process_id, arrival_time, cpu_burst of each process_id
    eg: 0,1,5

To run the program:
    execute 'execute.py' file once you're done modifying the text file.
